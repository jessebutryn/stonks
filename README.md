## Introduction

Stonks is a project designed to provide a streamlined and focused overview of key financial metrics for companies you care about. The primary goal is to quickly deliver essential insights into specific financial indicators such as debt, revenue growth, and free cash flow. While recognizing that past performance analysis cannot predict a company's future success, the emphasis here is on avoiding investments in companies with insufficient income and unmanageable debt. Stonks aims to empower users with a concise yet comprehensive snapshot of essential financial data, aiding in informed decision-making when considering potential investments.
